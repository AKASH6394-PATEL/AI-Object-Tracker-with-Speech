# AI Object Tracker with Speech ü§ñüîä

This is a Python project that uses OpenCV and YOLOv4-tiny to detect objects from a webcam. It also uses text-to-speech (TTS) to give voice feedback for each object detected, making it useful for visually impaired individuals.

This project was built as part of the CodeAlpha Internship (Task 4).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Setup: Download Model File

The YOLO model file (`yolov3-tiny.weights`) is too large (35 MB) to be hosted directly on GitHub.

**You must download it from the link below and place it in the same folder as the `.py` file.**

### ‚û°Ô∏è [Download yolov3-tiny.weights File Here]https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cbS1lxqd2TIVxaNQWyA9Te99byp2kP3_/view?usp=drive_link
*(Please make sure the file is named exactly `yolov3-tiny.weights`)*

## How to Run
1.  Download the `.weights` file from the link above.
2.  Place it in the same folder as the other files.
3.  Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```
    py object_tracking_with_speech.py
    ```
    py object_tracking_with_speech.py
    ```
